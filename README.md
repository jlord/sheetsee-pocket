# Hi!

A website for your Pocket article archive. Fork-n-Go set up.

### Fork-n-Go

This repository only has a **gh-pages branch** with web files - that means as soon as you **fork** it, you have a live version yourself! You'd be able to visit it at `yourGitHubName.github.io/sheetsee-pocket`. 

It would still be connected to my spreadsheet with my Pocket archive - but that's easy to change!

**Fork this!**

If you don't see your site, you may need to take [a few extra steps](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator) to get gh-pages enables.

#### Use ifttt.com for Pocket -> Spreadsheet

If you don't have already have an account with both [Pocket](http://www.getpocket.com) (a read-it-later service) and [ifttt.com](http://www.ifttt.com) go ahead and create em. If you don't have a [Google](http://drive.google.com) account, get on that too.

In ifttt.com set up [this recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/111549) that will take each article you archive on Pocket and add it to a row in a Google Spreadsheet.

_Now go read some things in your Pocket and archive 'em. You know, make the datas._

#### Set up Spreadsheet

Once you've got some entries, checkout your spreadsheet, change the column headers to: **date, article, tags, url, except**. Renaming won't break anything. Also, even though it's archiving an except, I'm not using in this project. But maybe you can find a neat way to use them?

While you're at your spreadsheet, you'll want to pusblish it to the web and get it's unique key. You can find the publish settings in the File menu by clicking *File > Publish to the Web*. Then click the "Start publishing" button.

It will then display the key in a window. Copy it!

#### Paste Your Spreadsheet Key

Now, visit your fork of this repository. Click the `index.html` file, and then when that page loads, click Edit.

Scroll to find **line 61** (or thereabouts), it looks like: 

```javascript
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
	  	var gData
	  	var URL = "0Ao5u1U6KYND7dFVkcnJRNUtHWUNKamxoRGg4ZzNiT3c"
			Tabletop.init( { key: URL, callback: showInfo, simpleSheet: true } ) 
    }) 
```
Paste your spreadsheet's key in the place of `0Ao5u1U6K...`

**At the bottom of the page, click Commit. You're done! Visit your site!**
